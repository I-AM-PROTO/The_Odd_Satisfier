Snake board: allow size setting (Done!)
           : allow difficulty setting (Done!)
           : Width must be higher than 2 (should start from 3)
           
Snake : done initial state on 11/08, actual game implementation left
      : 11/11 - the game somewhat... works... on cmd... GUI implementation should be done on WEEK2 (hopefully)
      : Left to do - game shouldn't stop for next input
                   - GUI
                   - settings?

AI: allow in game speed settings: speed 2x = duration .5x
