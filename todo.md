Snake board: allow size setting (Done!)

           : allow difficulty setting (Done!)
           
           : Width must be higher than 2 (should start from 3)
           
Snake
 
  : 11/08 - done initial state, actual game implementation left
      
  : 11/11 - the game somewhat... works... on cmd... GUI implementation should be done on WEEK2
      
   - Interactive gameplay
      
   - Should rethink autoplay algorithm for (odd, odd) size board
     
   - Swing (GUI)
                  
   - settings?

AI: allow in game speed settings: speed 2x = duration .5x (Should be okay as soon as Swing is fully done)
